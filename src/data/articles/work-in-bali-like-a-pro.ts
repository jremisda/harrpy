# Work in Bali Like a Pro: Tested Ways to Make Money on the Island

Most expatriates who work in Bali find themselves living a comfortable, almost luxurious lifestyle due to the relatively low cost of living compared to other countries. This island paradise offers more than just stunning beaches and vibrant culture – it presents unique opportunities to earn while enjoying an enhanced quality of life.

Despite agriculture being the largest industry in Bali, the tourism sector has been the major contributor to the island's GDP since the 1970s. This economic landscape creates diverse Bali job opportunities for foreigners, especially in hospitality and tourism-related fields. Additionally, the island boasts a highly developed small business sector, with numerous sewing factories producing clothing and accessories, making it an attractive destination for those looking to work and live in Bali.

However, jobs in Bali for expats can be challenging to secure through traditional means. Companies generally prefer hiring locals, and you'll need a personal tax number (NPWP) for legal employment. Fortunately, Indonesia has double taxation treaties with over 57 countries, which can benefit those pursuing remote work in Bali by preventing taxation in multiple jurisdictions.

In this guide, we'll explore tested strategies to make money while living on this tropical island – from leveraging online work to starting your own business. Whether you're considering a short-term adventure or a permanent lifestyle change, we've got practical advice to help you navigate Bali's economic landscape successfully.

## Remote Work and Online Income

Bali has emerged as a global hub for digital nomads and remote workers seeking to combine paradise living with productive careers. With Indonesia's e-commerce market projected to grow from USD 52.93 billion in 2023 to USD 86.81 billion by 2028, the island offers abundant opportunities for those wanting to work online while enjoying tropical living.

### Work remotely for your current employer

The Indonesian government recently introduced the E33G Remote Worker Visa, allowing foreigners to live in Bali while working for overseas employers for up to one year (extendable for an additional year). To qualify, you must earn at least USD 60,000 annually and maintain a minimum bank balance of USD 2,000. Remember that this visa strictly prohibits generating income from local Indonesian businesses.

### Start a freelance or consulting business

Freelancing presents a viable path for expats with specialized skills. Writers, virtual assistants, and online tutors are in high demand across various platforms. Although Bali offers no dedicated freelancer visa, the "Freelance KITAS" is available for 53 specific professions with a six-month duration. This requires a one-time tax payment of IDR 9,513,069 plus approximately IDR 15,855,115 for processing.

For consultants, business management and tourism consultancy are particularly promising fields. Moreover, consultancy businesses can be 100% foreign-owned according to Indonesian regulations.

### Run an online store or dropshipping business

Dropshipping has become increasingly popular among Bali-based entrepreneurs. With platforms like EPROLO, Lazada, and SaleHoo, you can sell products without handling inventory. Some entrepreneurs focus on authentic Balinese products, connecting local artisans with global markets.

### Offer digital services like design or writing

Digital services thriving in Bali include:

- Content creation and copywriting
- Web development and design
- Social media management
- Digital marketing

Freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and local job boards list numerous opportunities, with writing positions offering IDR 4-6 million monthly and design roles commanding IDR 8-12 million monthly.

If establishing a digital agency, focus on building a strong marketing plan and consider time zone differences when serving international clients. Nonetheless, ensure you understand the legal boundaries—pursuing the digital nomad lifestyle is acceptable only when conducting business outside Indonesia.

## Leverage Assets and Passive Income

Living in paradise while maintaining financial stability requires creative thinking. Generating passive income provides a solid foundation for those seeking to work and live in Bali long-term.

### Rent out your home or property back home

Turning your home country property into a rental asset can fund your Bali lifestyle. Villa rentals in Bali offer impressive annual rental yields ranging from 14% to 25%, significantly outperforming global averages. This approach essentially allows you to "milk the cow" with consistent income while enjoying island life.

Consider this real-world example: One investor purchased an off-plan loft for approximately IDR 1.25 billion, invested IDR 13.7 million in renovations, and now collects IDR 2.36 million monthly from a tenant. Over a 40-year period, a properly managed villa can generate up to IDR 28.15 billion in rental income.

### Live off dividends or investment income

Bali's real estate market presents exceptional investment opportunities for those looking to build passive income streams. Consequently, many expats fund their lifestyle through:

- Property investments with occupancy rates averaging 65-80% for rentals
- Real estate yielding returns of approximately 15% annually
- Capital appreciation of 15-20% yearly

Furthermore, investing in Bali real estate means you're not just generating income—you're creating a potential retirement destination with favorable living costs. Property management companies handle day-to-day operations, making this truly passive income.

### Use long service or sabbatical leave

Taking a sabbatical offers another pathway to experience life in Bali. Typically, sabbaticals last between 3 months and 1 year, with an average duration of 21 weeks. The most common sabbatical period is approximately 12 weeks.

Accordingly, I recommend choosing a career break that enhances your existing skills—perhaps by learning a language or gaining international work experience. This approach maintains your connection to your home country career while allowing you to experience Bali's unique work environment and lifestyle benefits.

## Start a Business in Bali

Entrepreneurship in Bali offers a path to establishing permanent roots on the island beyond remote work. The business landscape presents various opportunities for foreigners willing to navigate the regulatory environment.

### Buy an existing expat-run business

Purchasing an established business saves time and resources on bureaucratic hurdles and staff recruitment. Currently available businesses include boutique hotels, restaurants, wellness centers, and beauty salons with asking prices ranging from IDR 7.9 million to IDR 45.9 million. The hospitality sector shows particularly strong returns, with some businesses reporting revenues between IDR 3.9-7.9 million annually.

Before purchasing, verify all permits are in place—building permits (IMB), business licenses, and financial reports should be included in the sale. Most businesses are sold either because they were initially established for investment purposes or because owners are relocating.

### Create a niche service for tourists

Eco-tours, cultural experiences, and wellness retreats represent growing sectors in Bali's tourism market. Tour services focusing on authentic local experiences have flourished as tourists increasingly seek more than just beaches.

First-time entrepreneurs should consider specializing rather than offering generic services. Businesses with specialization often have higher success rates as they're perceived as more professional and expert in their field.

### Partner with locals to export goods

Partnering with locals provides valuable cultural insights and helps navigate regulatory complexities. Foreign investors typically have two options: establishing a PT PMA (Foreign-Owned Company) or forming a partnership with an Indonesian citizen.

Local partnerships simplify the process—they're more affordable, faster to establish, and ideal for smaller ventures like cafés or boutique stores. In contrast, PT PMA requires higher capital investment but offers full legal ownership and control.

### Open a surf, yoga, or wellness retreat

Wellness tourism in Bali continues to thrive, with retreat centers charging approximately IDR 1.5 million per person weekly. Successful retreats like Fivelements and COMO Shambhala have built their reputation by blending traditional Balinese healing practices with modern wellness approaches.

For surf retreats, locations like Bingin offer world-class waves suitable for beginners through experts. Prior to opening, secure proper licenses including NIB (Business Identification Number), TDUP (Tourism Business License), and environmental permits.

## Legal and Financial Setup

Securing the proper legal framework is foundational before you can work in Bali. Understanding the complex visa system and tax requirements will save you from potential fines, deportation, or even imprisonment.

### Understand visa types: KITAS, Business Visa, Retirement Visa

The KITAS (Kartu Izin Tinggal Terbatas) serves as your temporary stay permit in Indonesia. For employment, a Working KITAS paired with an IMTA (work permit) is mandatory. This typically costs between IDR 15.8-23.7 million and takes 2-3 months to process.

Business Visas come in single-entry (60 days) and multiple-entry (valid for 12 months with maximum 60-day stays) formats. These allow business meetings and negotiations but prohibit local employment.

For those over 55, the Retirement KITAS offers one-year stays (renewable up to 5 years) with a minimum monthly income requirement of USD 1,500. The premium 5-year E33E Silver Hair Visa requires proof of USD 3,000 monthly income and a USD 200,000 bank balance.

### Get a tax ID (NPWP) and stay compliant

All KITAS holders must obtain an NPWP (Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak) tax identification number. Without it, you'll face tax surcharges—20% instead of 10% on rental income. Application requires your passport, KITAS, and proof of residence.

Failure to obtain an NPWP while earning taxable income results in fines of 2-4 times unpaid tax amounts. Repeated violations can lead to 6 months to 6 years imprisonment.

### Use a visa sponsor or consulting agency

Sponsors are legally responsible for foreigners during their stay in Indonesia. Companies can sponsor Work KITAS, while visa agents handle most other visa types except family-related permits.

### Avoid working illegally on a tourist visa

Indonesia takes a zero-tolerance approach toward foreigners working on tourist visas. Penalties include:

- Daily fines of IDR 1 million for overstays
- Fines up to IDR 500 million for working illegally
- Possible imprisonment for up to five years

Remember that remote work for overseas employers requires the specific E33G Remote Worker Visa, not a tourist visa.

## Conclusion

Bali truly offers a unique opportunity for those seeking to blend tropical paradise living with productive work. Throughout this guide, we've explored multiple pathways to earning while enjoying this island's remarkable lifestyle advantages. Remote work stands out as perhaps the most accessible option, especially with Indonesia's new E33G Remote Worker Visa specifically designed for digital nomads.

Passive income strategies provide another solid foundation for long-term island living. Property investments yield impressive returns compared to global averages, while sabbaticals offer a temporary taste of Bali life without completely disconnecting from your career back home.

Starting a business certainly demands more commitment but rewards entrepreneurs with deeper roots in the community. Whether purchasing an existing operation or creating something new, the business landscape remains vibrant despite regulatory challenges.

Above all, legal compliance must remain your priority. The consequences of working illegally can be severe, including substantial fines and potential imprisonment. Therefore, securing the right visa, obtaining proper permits, and paying taxes accordingly should precede any income-generating activities.

After considering all these options, you'll likely find that working in Bali offers more than just financial rewards. The island's unique cultural experiences, natural beauty, and welcoming community create an environment where work and life balance naturally. Many expats discover that their productivity actually improves amid this relaxed yet inspiring setting.

Most importantly, remember that success in Bali requires flexibility, patience with bureaucratic processes, and respect for local customs. When these elements align with your professional skills and financial strategy, this island paradise can become much more than a vacation destination—it transforms into a sustainable, enriching lifestyle choice.
